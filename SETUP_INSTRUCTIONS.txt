  QUICK START GUIDE - Medical Reports Cloud Storage Fix
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PROBLEM FIXED:
--------------
✓ Medical reports now stored in Cloudinary cloud storage
✓ Files accessible from ALL instances (local & deployed)
✓ No more missing reports between computers
✓ Persistent storage that survives server restarts


IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:
--------------------------

1. GET CLOUDINARY ACCOUNT (Free):
   → Go to: https://cloudinary.com/users/register/free
   → Sign up and verify email
   → Get your 3 credentials from dashboard:
     - Cloud Name
     - API Key  
     - API Secret


2. ADD TO LOCAL .env FILE:
   → Open: back_end/.env
   → Add these 3 lines:
   
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name-here
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret-here


3. ADD TO RENDER (Backend Deployment):
   → Dashboard: https://dashboard.render.com/
   → Select your backend service
   → Go to "Environment" tab
   → Add 3 environment variables:
     CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME
     CLOUDINARY_API_KEY
     CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET
   → Save (auto-redeploys)


4. RESTART LOCAL SERVER:
   → Stop backend (Ctrl+C)
   → Start: npm start


5. TEST IT:
   → Upload a new medical report
   → File URL should start with: https://res.cloudinary.com/
   → View from different computers - should work!

FREE TIER LIMITS:
-----------------
• 25 GB storage
• 25 GB monthly bandwidth
• More than enough for most uses

-----------------------
□ Cloudinary account created
□ 3 environment variables added to local .env
