# Phase 3B Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Hybrid Collection Tracking System

**Completed:** October 13, 2025

---

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Request Status System**

**New Status Values:**
- `pending` - Initial request
- `approved` - Admin approved with collection date
- `collected` - User confirmed collection
- `verified` - Admin verified the collection
- `no-show` - User didn't collect on time (auto-detected)
- `rejected` - Request denied with reason
- `cancelled` - User cancelled the request
- `reschedule-requested` - User requested new date

---

### 2. **Backend Implementation**

#### **Updated Models (`back_end/src/models/Request.ts`)**

**New Fields Added:**
```typescript
// Approval/Rejection
rejectionReason?: string;

// Collection tracking
collectionDate?: Date;
collectionLocation?: string;
collectionInstructions?: string;
collectedAt?: Date;
collectedByUserConfirmation?: boolean;
verifiedByAdmin?: boolean;
verifiedAt?: Date;
verifiedByUserId?: ObjectId;

// Reschedule
rescheduleRequested?: boolean;
rescheduleReason?: string;
originalCollectionDate?: Date;
newRequestedDate?: Date;
rescheduleApproved?: boolean;

// No-show
noShowDetectedAt?: Date;
noShowReason?: string;

// Cancellation
cancelledAt?: Date;
cancellationReason?: string;
```

#### **New API Endpoints (`back_end/src/controllers/requestController.ts`)**

**User Actions:**
1. `POST /api/requests/:id/confirm-collection` - User confirms they collected blood
2. `POST /api/requests/:id/request-reschedule` - User requests new collection date
3. `POST /api/requests/:id/cancel` - User cancels request (inventory restored)

**Admin Actions:**
1. `PATCH /api/requests/:id/verify-collection` - Admin verifies collection
2. `PATCH /api/requests/:id/mark-collected` - Admin manually marks as collected
3. `PATCH /api/requests/:id/mark-no-show` - Admin marks as no-show (inventory restored)
4. `POST /api/requests/:id/handle-reschedule` - Admin approves/denies reschedule

**System/Cron:**
1. `POST /api/system/check-no-shows` - Auto-detects and marks no-shows

#### **Updated Existing Endpoints:**

**Approval (`POST /api/requests/:id/approve`):**
- Now requires: `collectionDate`, `collectionLocation`
- Optional: `collectionInstructions`
- Sets all collection details

**Rejection (`POST /api/requests/:id/reject`):**
- Now requires: `rejectionReason` (mandatory)
- Cannot reject without providing reason
