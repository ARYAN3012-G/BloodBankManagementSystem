# ✅ How to Verify Collection

## What "Pending Verification" Means:

When you see **"Pending Verification"** in the Actions column, it means:
- ✅ User clicked "I Collected the Blood"
- ✅ Status changed to **COLLECTED**
- ⏳ Waiting for admin to verify

---

## How Admin Verifies:

### **Step 1: Refresh Frontend**
Since I just added the verify button, refresh your browser:
- Press **F5** or **Ctrl+R**

### **Step 2: Go to Admin Requests**
1. Login as **admin**
2. Go to **Admin Panel** → **Requests** tab
3. Find the request with status **COLLECTED**

### **Step 3: Click "✓ Verify" Button**
In the Actions column, you'll now see:
- **✓ Verify** button (blue)

Click it!

### **Step 4: Done!**
- Alert appears: "Collection verified successfully!"
- Status changes to **VERIFIED** ✅
- Request is complete! 🎉

---

## Complete Flow:

```
1. User submits request → PENDING
2. Admin approves with date/location → APPROVED
3. User clicks "I Collected" → COLLECTED (Pending Verification)
4. Admin clicks "✓ Verify" → VERIFIED ✅
```

## What You'll See:

### **Before Verify (COLLECTED status):**
| Blood Group | Status    | Actions            |
|-------------|-----------|---------------------|
| AB+         | COLLECTED | [👁️] [✓ Verify] [⋮] |

### **After Verify (VERIFIED status):**
| Blood Group | Status   | Actions       |
|-------------|----------|---------------|
| AB+         | VERIFIED | [👁️] [⋮]       |

---

## Testing Now:

1. **Refresh browser** (F5)
2. **Go to Admin → Requests**
3. **Find AB+ request** with status "COLLECTED"
4. **Click "✓ Verify"** button
5. **Alert** appears
6. **Status** changes to VERIFIED ✅

---

**It should work now! Just refresh the page and click the verify button!** 🚀
